# timetable
Project on preparation of timetable.

Worked on designing an algorithm for the auto-generation of the scheduler for the college considering the parameters including the credits of the subjects. Heuristic approach was followed to develop the logic for this classic problem. The implementation of it can be found here. Inputs are taken from the user such as no_of_classes,courses and credits for the generation of the schedule.
